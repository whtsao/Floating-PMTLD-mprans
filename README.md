# PMTLD-in-waves-Proteus
Tuned liquid damper filled with porous media installed on a Floating body by Proteus

This is an uncompleted work that stuck in setting up the wave-body-porous media configurations.

For directory set 1, the subdomains are set in one time, but fail to attach body.

For directory set 2, the subdomains of the wave channel (including relaxation zones) and the porous zone are set first, then the other subdomain of body is set. But fail to combine the two CustomShape.
